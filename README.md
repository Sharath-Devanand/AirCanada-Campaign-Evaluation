# Airline Loyalty Analysis

## Project Background

I am a Data Analyst for Air Canada partnering with the Marketing department to extract membership and demographic insights from flights booked in the yeat 2018. With 400K+ records presenting flights booked solo and companion with points accumulaed and redeemed, the goal is to identify demographic sectors with higher loyalty (more flights and points accumulated) and the effectiveness of memberships in the 2018 Marketing campaign.


## Executive Background


## Data Description

The dataset consists of two tables - Customer and Flight with the following attributes

1. Customer - The customer table is sectioned into two categories for easier interpretation
    1.1 Demographic - Demographic section of the Customer tables gives five attributes - Gender, Location, Education, Marital Status and Salary
    1.2 Membership - The month and year of enrollment and cancellation (if cancelled) along with the card type, enrollment type and the Customer Lifetime Value is present in the membership section of the customer table.
2. Flight - The flight table presents the year and month of flight booking based on the loyalty number along with the count of solo and companion flights booked. It also gives the points accumulated and redeemed by the member.
